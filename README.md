# Clean Air Device - an open UV-C aircleaner unit

## What is this?
This respository contains the building plans to build a DIY aircleaner based on UV-C radiation - the "cleanair" device.
The large device consists of 6 36W UV-C lamps in a flight cases with extra space for electronics and the ESP32 control unit. The small one can be printed using a 3d printer capable of printing 20cm x 20cm blocks and include 2 lamps. 


## Getting started
In order to get started you have to decice if you want to build the large device or the small one. The large is device is mostly build by hand where the smaller one can be 3D-printed.

More information can be found in the [documentation section](documentation/README.md).


## Warning!
This device uses UV-C lamps which will damage skin and eyes. BE CAREFUL AND DO NOT TURN THE LAMPS ON OUTSIDE THE CASING!




## FAQ
### Why is it free?
We at MaibornWolff believe we have a responsibility in these difficult times to society. As an IT company we had a good business year, regardless of Corona, and now it is time to use our knowledge in creating IT solutions to build an affordable and free air cleaner everyone can use. 
We will not build our own "MaibornWolff Air Cleaner" unit and sell it. We have no whatsoever financial interest - instead we encourage you to help us make the device better, more easy to use, more cheaper to produce so everyone - companies, schools, kindergardens - could probably have one. 

### How can I help?
Clone this repository, make the code, the device itself better and create a PR :-)
