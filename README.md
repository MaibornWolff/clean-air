# Clean Air Device - an open UV-C aircleaner unit

## What is this?

This repository contains the building plans to build a DIY-air-cleaner based on UV-C radiation - the "cleanair" device.
The large device consists of 6 36W UV-C lamps in a flight case with extra space for electronics and the ESP32 control unit. The small one contains 2 lamps and can be printed using a 3d printer capable of printing 22cm x 22cm blocks.

## Getting started

In order to get started you have to device if you want to build the large device or the small one. The large is device is mostly build by hand where the smaller one can be 3D-printed.

More information can be found in the [documentation section](documentation/README.md).

## Warning!

This device uses UV-C lamps which will damage skin and eyes. BE CAREFUL AND DO NOT TURN THE LAMPS ON OUTSIDE THE CASING!

## FAQ

### Why is it free?

We at MaibornWolff believe we have a responsibility to society, especially in these difficult times. As an IT company we had a good business year, regardless of Corona, and now it is time to use our knowledge in creating IT solutions to build an affordable and free air cleaner everyone can use.
We will not build our own "MaibornWolff Air Cleaner" unit and sell it. We have no whatsoever financial interest. Instead, we encourage you to help us make the device better, more easy to use, more cheap to produce, so everyone - companies, schools, kindergardens - could probably have one.
