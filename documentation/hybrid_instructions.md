## Preparation


## Step 1
Assemble 2 small wood plates with one large as shown, apply the reflective material to the inside. Mount both light filters. Use a template to predrill the necessary holes to hit the mounting holes of the light filters. 
Install 4 fans in each honeycomb part using the included fans mounting screws. Ensure that that one honeycomb has the fans facing up, the other down, as they need to transport the air in the same direction when directed apart from each other in the device. 
Thread the cable through the light filters and mount honeycombs to the device.

## Step 2
Apply reflective material to the wooden front plate. Prepare the mainboard, solder all components and flash the ESP32.
Mount the mainboard to the case with 4 m3 screws, leds facing the light channels and secure the case in place with short wooden screws. Connect the encoder knob with 5 jumper wires as labeled on the mainboard. Connect the fans using splitter cables to the main fan connector. 
Mount the power socket, both ballasts and the 12v power supply unit. Connect the wires as shown in the electric connection overview, be sure to use the right wires for every part as described by the manufacturers. 
Fixture holders are wrapped in reflective material and mounted on the wooden plate. Use a printed template to find the right positions. Connect the 2g11 socket to the ballasts following the schema printed on the ballasts and secure them on the nearest fixture-holder. Install the open-end-holder on the other side, install the electronics case lid and all four uvc lights. If a temperature sensor is used, secure the sensor with contact to the critical ballasts. 
Double check all connections.
protect all connectors with 3d printed lids and cover up everything with reflective material.

## Step 3
Combine the front plate with the main case and using the same template as in step 2, secure the fixture holders from the opposite side through the wooden plate. If everything is closed, the device is ready to be used. You may give it a paint job, add rubber feet or a handle for easy transportation.
