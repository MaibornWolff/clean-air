# Documentation

The documentation covers all information around the UV-C clean air units.

## DIY Hardware

### Calculations

Estimations about the irradiance and considerations about the room size for which such a device could be feasible are located [here](theory.pdf).

### Electronics

### Small 3d printed model

The small 3d printed model is a UV-C cleaner with up to 4 lamps and up to 8 fans. Based on our calculations the small device is capable of handling rooms with a size of up to 25,3m² (assuming 2.5m ceiling height), using 4x 55W UV-C lamps and fans with a total throughput of 380m³/h.

See [3d model documentation](3dmodel.md).

### Wooden model

The wooden model is a full sized DIY case, providing 6 lamps and 4 fans.

See [wooden model documentation](/hardware/all_wood/README.md).
