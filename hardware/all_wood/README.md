This hardware version is mainly build out of wood, which can be cut to length by most hardware stores or in a home workshop. For the light shutters, a combination of angle-profiles and wooden mounts is used.
Those mounts can either be cut with a CNC, 3d printed or carved with hand tools. A technical drawing is included in this repository.
